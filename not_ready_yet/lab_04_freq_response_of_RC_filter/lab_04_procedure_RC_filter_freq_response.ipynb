    "In dynamic systems, frequency response refers to investigating how a system will response to fixed sine inputs of various frequencies.  As the frequency of the input sine wave changes, the magnitude of the output and the phase difference between the input and output will also change. The results of frequency response testing over a wide range of frequencies can be shown on a Bode plot, which is a powerful tool for experimental system identification."

    "If a sinusoidal input is given to a stable dynamic system, after transients die out the output will be a sine wave at the same frequency as the input.  However, the amplitude of the output may be larger or smaller than the amplitude of the input and there may be a phase difference between the two.  Plotting the magnitude ratio and the phase versus input frequency can tell us a lot about the system."
