So, the Raspberry Pi will communicate with both Arduinos using these same connections.  Pin `A4` is `SDA` on an Uno and `A5` is `SCL`.  You will also need to connect `5V` and `GND`.  Use the screw terminals on the red hats to make these connections Raspberry Pi and the Uno.  Remember that the RPi needs to communicate with both Arduinos, so do not disconnect the i$^2$c wires from the Mega."

Connect 5V and GND to appropriate spots on the Uno.  The green and white wires connect to pins 2 and 3 - but which is which is a guess for now.  You will verify that you have them correct using an open-loop pulse test.  If the sign is backwards, you will later swap the green and white wires."
