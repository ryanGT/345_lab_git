However, you are now working with a different system and there are some experimental details that require additional attention. The main issue is that there is very little chance you could damage the RC filter lby running a test with bad parameters. And this week's lab, there is some risk of you breaking the beam and it will also require a little bit more effort to get good data.\n"
