    "## Transfer Function Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "A transfer function is an input/output model of a dynamic system. The transfer function represents the underlying differential equation that relates the input and output for the dynamic system.  A transfer function is a fraction with a polynomial of s in the numerator and denominator.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G(s) = \\frac{3s+2}{s^2+7s+15}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And in general:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G(s) = \\frac{b_m s^m + b_{m-1} s^{m-1} + \\cdots + b_1 s + b_0}{s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 s + a_0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Any polynomial that has real coefficients can be factored into a product of first and second order terms.  So, the numerator and denominator of a transfer function can be thought of as products of such terms.  The roots of the denominator polynomial are referred to as poles and the roots of the numerator polynomial are referred to as zeros.  So I transfer function is made up of some combination of first or second order poles and potentially first or second order zeros.  Additionally, a pole at the origin (1/s) is referred to as a pure integrator and a zero at the origin (s) is referred to as a pure differentiator.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are essentially six building blocks that an engineer can use to assemble a transfer function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- first order pole\n",
    "- second order pole\n",
    "- pure integrator\n",
    "- first order zero\n",
    "- second order zero\n",
    "- pure differentiator\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are just getting started, we will only focus on poles and pure integrators in this week's lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an engineer is trying to infer the form of a transfer function based on experimental data, it is best to recognize which of these six building blocks needs to be included in the transfer function and then multiply those terms together.  In order to develop this skill, it is important for students to know how each of the building blocks responds to various inputs.\n",
