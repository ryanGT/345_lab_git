    "- PD tuning\n",
    "- control design based on root locus or symbolic CLTF analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform the design, you will need a TF for the system.  Since the system is open-loop stable, you can do Bode analysis based on open-loop swept-sine input.  You could also perform system ID based on an open-loop pulse test.\n",

In order to make this happen, you need to use an `if_block` to send zero to your motors until a condition is met.  Use a `loop_count` block to measure time.  There are 500 loop counts per second.  There is a variable on the Arduino that gets incremented each time the timer interrupt occurs.  If you combine the `loop_count` with a greater than block and the `if_block`, you can make the Arduino wait to turn on the vibration suppression until a condition is satisfied."
