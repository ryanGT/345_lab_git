    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, you will develop a vibration suppresion controller two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PD tuning\n",
    "- control design based on root locus or symbolic CLTF analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform the design, you will need a TF for the system.  Since the system is open-loop stable, you can do Bode analysis based on open-loop swept-sine input.  You could also perform system ID based on an open-loop pulse test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You **must** perform an open-loop pulse test to verify the sign of your encoder/h-bridge relationship before putting the system under feedback control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded based on the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- your system ID process and the TF you come up with\n",
    "- your control design process\n",
    "- the performance of your system in a final verification test"
