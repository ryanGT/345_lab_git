This is very similar to what we did in lab 1 except that we need to find the step response at the same points in time where we have experimental data.  There are two options for doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve the step response symbolically with $p$ as a variable and then just have your `mymodel` function use that symbolic expression\n",

    "challenge: `control.step_response` expects the time vector to have\n",
    "perfect time steps that are exactly the same.  Essentially, it is expecting that your time vector was created using `np.arange`.  So, you need to find a way to create a fake, perfect time vector that is as close as possible to your real, experimental time vector.  Find the average time step `dt` from your experimental time vector and use it along with `np.arange` to create a fake time vector that has the same length as the experimental time vector.\n",
